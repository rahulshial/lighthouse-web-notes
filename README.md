# Rahul Shial's Notes

## Summary 

This repository contains all of the notes taken by [Rahul Shial](https://github.com/rahulshial) for the [Lighthouse Labs](https://www.lighthouselabs.ca/) Web Development Bootcamp. 
October 26, 2020 was my first day of the Bootcamp, and it has been exhilarating so far. Bradley, Kelly Glen & Andy have made us feel very welcome, and I am on my way to becoming a software developer.

Points to remember:
1. Ask for Help
2. Keep the hours (12 hours a day)
3. Take breaks and sleep well
4. Don't compare yourself to others
5. Get comfortable being uncomfortable.

In this activity, I am learning how to add a repository and update my notes.
